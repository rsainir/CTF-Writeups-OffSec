## A Security Analyst's Toolbox (in progress!!)

##This is a segment of my GitHub page that stores a lot of Security (both offensive and defensive) related information and tools.
##Writeups of solutions from past CTFs can be found here when they are created and released to the public.

Note: All tools and exploits are meant to be used in a LEGAL and ETHICAL capacity with full consent from party that is being tested/analyzed
