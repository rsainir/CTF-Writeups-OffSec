# The Challenge

This encrypted flag will only require a simple substitution cipher to solve. Rearrange the letters from A to Z.

# Solution

Given that the ciphertext is a substituiton cipher, we can rule out other ciphers.

Since we are hinted towards rearranging letters from A to Z, we try a Alphabetical substitution cipher on https://cryptii.com/pipes/alphabetical-substitution

Which yields the flag** MetaCTF{bashful_is_my_fav_dwarf}**
